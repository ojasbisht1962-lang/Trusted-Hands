# Dual-Role Feature Implementation

## Overview
Users can now have both Customer and Tasker roles simultaneously and switch between them without re-logging in.

## What Changed

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **User Model** (`app/models/user.py`)
- Added `roles` field: List of all roles user has access to
- Kept `role` field: Current active role for backward compatibility

```python
role: UserRole  # Current active role
roles: Optional[List[UserRole]] = []  # All available roles
```

#### 2. **Authentication Logic** (`app/routes/auth.py`)
- **Login Flow:**
  - When existing user logs in with new role, it's ADDED to their roles list
  - User is not limited to one role anymore
  - SuperAdmin role remains locked (cannot be changed)
  
- **New Endpoint:** `POST /auth/switch-role`
  - Allows switching between available roles without re-login
  - Validates user has access to requested role
  - Returns new JWT token with updated role
  - Updates current active role in database

**Example Flow:**
1. User signs up as **Customer** ‚Üí roles: ["customer"]
2. Later logs in as **Tasker** ‚Üí roles: ["customer", "tasker"]
3. Can now switch between both roles anytime

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **AuthContext** (`context/AuthContext.js`)
- Added `switchRole(newRole)` function
- Added `hasMultipleRoles` boolean
- Added `availableRoles` array
- Tracks user's current and available roles

#### 2. **API Service** (`services/apiService.js`)
- Added `switchRole(role)` API call to backend

#### 3. **RoleSwitcher Component** (`components/RoleSwitcher.js`)
- New component showing current role mode
- Dropdown to switch between available roles
- Only visible when user has multiple roles
- Beautiful UI with role icons and labels

**Features:**
- üõí Customer Mode
- üîß Tasker Mode  
- üëë Admin Mode (if applicable)
- Smooth animations
- Active role highlighted
- Auto-navigates to appropriate dashboard

#### 4. **Navbar Integration** (`components/Navbar.js`)
- RoleSwitcher placed before Profile Menu
- Responsive design (hides label on mobile)

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: New User
1. Sign up with Google
2. Select "Customer" role
3. Use platform as customer
4. Later decide to offer services
5. Login again, select "Tasker"
6. **Result:** Now have both roles, can switch anytime

### Scenario 2: Existing User with Multiple Roles
1. Login to platform
2. See RoleSwitcher button showing current mode (e.g., "Customer Mode üõí")
3. Click to see dropdown with all available roles
4. Click "Tasker Mode üîß" to switch
5. **Result:** Instantly switch to Tasker dashboard with new navigation
6. All data preserved, just different view

### Scenario 3: Role Switching
```
Customer View:
- Dashboard: Bookings stats, recent services
- Can browse services, book taskers
- Access AMC requests, chat

‚ÜïÔ∏è SWITCH ‚ÜïÔ∏è

Tasker View:
- Dashboard: Earnings, pending jobs
- Can create services, manage bookings
- Accept/reject requests, chat
```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Data Preservation
- **Customer data preserved:** All bookings, reviews, AMC requests
- **Tasker data preserved:** Services created, received bookings, earnings
- No data loss when switching roles

### ‚úÖ Seamless Experience
- No need to logout/login
- One-click role switching
- Automatic dashboard navigation
- Maintains authentication

### ‚úÖ Flexibility
- Act as both customer and service provider
- Book services when needed
- Offer services to earn
- Full access to both ecosystems

### ‚úÖ Business Logic
- Same Google account, multiple capabilities
- Unified chat system across roles
- Consistent profile information
- Single notification system

## API Endpoints

### Switch Role
```http
POST /auth/switch-role?role=customer
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "new_jwt_token",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user": {
    "_id": "user_id",
    "role": "customer",
    "roles": ["customer", "tasker"],
    ...
  },
  "message": "Switched to customer role successfully"
}
```

### Error Cases
- **403:** Role not available (haven't logged in as that role yet)
- **403:** SuperAdmin cannot switch roles
- **403:** Account is blocked

## Security

### Authorization
- JWT token regenerated on role switch
- Token contains updated role claim
- All protected endpoints validate role from token
- Cannot access unauthorized role endpoints

### Validation
- Can only switch to roles in user's `roles` array
- SuperAdmin role is locked
- Blocked users cannot switch roles
- Role must be valid enum value

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Add Second Role
1. Login as Customer
2. Logout
3. Login again, select Tasker
4. Verify `roles: ["customer", "tasker"]`
5. RoleSwitcher should appear

### Test Case 2: Switch Roles
1. Login with multiple roles
2. Click RoleSwitcher
3. Select different role
4. Verify navigation to correct dashboard
5. Verify navigation tabs updated

### Test Case 3: Role Persistence
1. Switch to Tasker
2. Refresh page
3. Verify still in Tasker mode
4. Switch to Customer
5. Close and reopen browser
6. Verify in Customer mode

## Migration Notes

### Existing Users
- Existing users have only `role` field populated
- On next login, `roles` array will be created with current role
- If they login as different role, it will be added
- Backward compatible

### Database Updates
- No migration script needed
- Gradual rollout as users login
- Old `role` field maintained for compatibility

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
1. **Role Badges:** Show all roles on profile
2. **Quick Switch Hotkey:** Keyboard shortcut to switch
3. **Role Preferences:** Remember last used role
4. **Analytics:** Track how often users switch roles
5. **Unified Dashboard:** Show data from all roles in one view
